        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        " - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Popular due to its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and wide range of applications like web development, data science, AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "  - An interpreter executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine code at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "  - Reserved words with special meanings that cannot be used as identifiers like if, else, for, while, def, class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        " - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "What is mutability in Python? Mutability refers to whether an object's state can be modified after it's created. Mutable objects can be changed, immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python\n",
        " - Mutability refers to whether an object's state can be modified after it's created. Mutable objects can be changed, immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        " - Lists are designed for dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or changed. Tuples are designed for fixed collections where the elements should not change after creation, offering data integrity and sometimes better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        " -  == checks for value equality like if two objects have the same content. is checks for identity equality like if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python\n",
        " - Operators used to combine conditional statements: and, or, not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python\n",
        " - Explicitly converting a variable from one data type to another like  int, str, float.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        " - Implicit : Python automatically converts data types during an operation\n",
        "Explicit : The programmer explicitly converts data types using built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        " - To execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false. e.g: if, elif, else.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work\n",
        "- elif (else if) allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the preceding if or elif conditions are false, the elif condition is evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        " - for loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, string, range) or other iterable objects a predetermined number of times.\n",
        "while loop: Used for repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The number of iterations is not typically known beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        " -  A while loop is more suitable when you need to repeat an action until a certain condition is met, and you don't know in advance how many times that action will need to be performed. For example, reading user input until a valid input is provided, or in a game loop that continues until the game ends.\n",
